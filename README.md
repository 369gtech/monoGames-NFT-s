<h1>monoGames NFT's</h1>

<p>NFT's (Non Fungible Tokes) are the heart and soul of our monoGames Metaverse that can connect to The Real World. monoGames NFT's will be for sale on each of the Faction NFT Market Places (Signum, Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, DOGE, Pirate Chain, Dragonchain, Koinos, Hive, Wax, BSC and Zill.) especially the Signum Market Place. You will need a Faction Wallet to buy these NFT and if your new its really simple to buy these NFT's with Signum just click the <a href="https://www.signumart.io/">Link<a/>, press CREATE and then CONNECT your wallet. Factions that don't have an NFT Market Place will automatically be listed on the <a href="https://www.signumart.io/">Signum Market Place</a>.</p>

In these packs could be a common, rare, epic, legendary and also monoTomic Gold. The Rarity Odds of winning a common is 100%, rare is 25%, epic is 15%, legendary is 5% and monoTomic Gold is 1%. You can upgrade NFT's in the Destiny Of The Universe, Social Lounges and in the Sustainability of the game you will need to combine cards which is essentially burning NFT's. The higher the level of your NFT's the more daily rewards you will receive. In most instances every NFT you hold has an earning opportunity once it is staked. Some NFT's will help you improve your social standings to improve your <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Factions">Faction</a> Status like your monoAvatar NFT and monoAvatar Matrix. So initially there are a lot NFT's but as the game progresses and more people combine cards the more scarce the cards will be in each Faction so the prices for the NFT's should go up over time.  
</p><p>
Personal Land Packages and Diamond Supremacy NFT's are the only NFT's you will need to buy singularly. You can buy the Personal Land Packages in the game. The Diamond Supremacy NFT's are one of a kind series of NFT's for each Faction and only the highest bidder will ever own these NFT because it is always on the market but the highest bidder will be able to use these NFT's as they will have vary rare abilities.

monoGames NFT's are community inspired and are created by the <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/monoGames-NFT-Creative-Art-Community">monoGames NFT Creative Art Community</a>. But in the future we hope to add more special <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Factions">Faction</a> orientated NFT's like an 
exhibition to show case the history of the Faction Blockchain. But we have so many other ideas to develop and grow our game with NFT's that the sky, the universe or should I say the Metaverse is our oyster to create the future NFT's of monoGames. Also each game in the <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Alpha-monoGames">Alpha monoGames</a> series of games created by developers may also have packs included in their games too, so refer to those games for their pack sales.
