<h1>monoGames NFT's</h1>

<p>monoGames NFT's are the heart and soul of our gaming metaverse. When you first join monoGames, the first quest is to create your personal <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/monoAvatar">Avatar</a> and then you are introduced to your <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/monoAvatar-Matrix">monoAvatar Mtrix</a> and nft <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Portal-Faction-Land-Packages">Portal Fraction Land</a> to build, so as you grow in monoGames you will experience how truly amazing our nft metaverse is. 
  
In most instances every nft you hold has an earning opportunity once it is staked. Some nft's will help you improve your social standings to improve you <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Factions">Faction</a> Status, Battle nft's that you upgrade will help you battle in your <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Factions">Faction</a> and other nft's give you the opportunity to own <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Portal-Faction-Land-Packages">Portal Fraction Land</a> to earn but there are so man more opportunities to earn and play with monoGames nft's.

monoGames NFT's are community inspired and are created by the <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/monoGames-NFT-Creative-Art-Community">monoGames NFT Creative Art Community</a>. But in the future we hope to add more special <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Factions">Faction</a> orientated nft's like a Museum to show case the history of the faction coin. But we have so many other ideas to develop and grow our game with nft's that the sky, the universe or should I say the metaverse is our oyster to create the future NFT's of monoGames.
